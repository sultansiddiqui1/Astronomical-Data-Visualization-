# Astronomical-Data-Visualization-
Visualizing and Analyzing Astronomical Data Using Python
 A project where we take data about stars and do the  following:
 1. we initially load the data in **Excel**, and using the **power filter** of Excel, we make sure that  the data is clean and no funny values are involved in it.
 2. After initially looking at the CSV file in Excel we load the CSV file in **jupyter notebook**.
 3. I use **pandas** and **os** from Python to create **data frames** and carry out s**imple exploratory data analysis**.
 4. I use **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to then various charts and graphs
 5. I  start with normal **bar graphs** to understand how many  stars we have per category. I have made bar graphs using both Matplotlib and also seaborn.
 7. I then created b**ox plots** for all the numeric values using **subplots**, making it easier for people, especially machine learning enthusiasts who might       want to use this data to build models to **identify outliers**.
 8. I then went ahead and created **line plots** for all the numeric values to see if we have some trends in our data.
 9. I then create a **Pair Plot** to see how values change with respect to each other, there are some interesting patterns, and we can see how one value     
    changes with respect to another.
 10. Since we are working with stars and data related to stars, it of course does not make sense to not make a **HR chart**.An HR diagram, also known as a   
    **Hertzsprung-Russell diagram** is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the starsâ€™  absolute magnitudes or luminosities and their 
    stellar classifications or effective temperatures. It is a fundamental tool in astronomy, used to understand the life cycle of stars and their evolutionary 
    stages,for people interested in astronomy.

11. Lastly i would like to invite you to look at the visualizations and draw out some trends and information about our stars and celestial bodies, draw out         trends and share my love for story telling.
